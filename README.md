- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehackett00!
- 👀I’m interested in early pre-school education, programming and DJaying.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git hub, Adobe Acrobat SDK, Java Script, Xcode and Swift,Zsh, and  Python!  I also want to review C and C++; it has been 20 years since I took the course. Maybe  discover what C# is all about.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on extendScript for Acrobat; however right now I see myself more as a student.
- 📫 I can be reached at the following email:
